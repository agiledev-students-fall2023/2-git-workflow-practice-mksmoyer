## Comments

This article caught my attention due to its direct relevance to this assignment. This class is my first time using git or github, so it is interesting to learn more about it and its relevance in a real business environment. Reading about Microsoft exposing tons of private information in a github repository because of a small mistake with a shared access signature token shows that data can be vulnerable while using git repositories. While the work in this class may not necessarily include any very important information, this issue could be relevant in many situations, especially in the current computing ecosystem which processes larger and larger amounts of data every day.
